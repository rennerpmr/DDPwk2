## Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r makemap, echo = TRUE}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
my_map = addMarkers(my_map, lat = 45.299261, lng = -121.017938, popup = "Pine Tree Boat Launch")
my_map


```
